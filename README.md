# termux-botnet

This is an SSH botnet manager I created for people who use termux,but it can also work fort other terminals.
You need to create a .txt file with the "Add Bots" sub menu.This App uses a txt file u have where each line 
is in the format of "Host User Password" so if you have made a backup of your botnet you can use this or if 
you have computers, servers, or routers that you own(wink wink)and want to control remotely then you can use
this to do that.

Thx, you can edit it if u want,but please dont change the created by Zylux in the banner(I'm Zylux)
Thx,and enjoy!
